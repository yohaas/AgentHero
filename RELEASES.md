Release summaries are listed newest-first. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) has the detailed releases.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-05-24

AgentHero 0.1.12 packages the latest app improvements into a new full release:

- Adds new built-in Marketing and Quality agents for focused specialist chats.
- Improves project switching and long-chat rendering responsiveness.
- Shows the active model in the mobile chat header.
- Keeps remembered shell approval prefixes cleaner and easier to reuse.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-05-10

AgentHero 0.1.11 adds an optional automatic chat history alongside the existing manual Saved Chats:

- Closed chats are archived automatically when the new "Automatically save chat history" setting is on (Settings → General).
- Open the History dialog from the Saved Chats panel — or from the new History button in the header next to Settings — to review the initial prompt, created date, and last activity for each archived chat.
- Save an archived chat to keep it permanently in Saved Chats, or delete it.
- Configure how many days of inactivity are retained, or set 0 to never auto-delete.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-05-07

AgentHero 0.1.10 ships a new Windows full installer with reliability fixes for approvals, queued messages, and notifications:

- Approval prompts resolve more reliably on the first click, including Codex approval requests.
- Queued chat messages are persisted across server restarts and protected from empty reconnect snapshots.
- Browser notifications work more consistently on macOS by routing through the service worker when needed.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-05-05

AgentHero 0.1.9 shipped a new Windows full installer and release bundle with the recent Codex workflow improvements:

- Codex launches now separate mode selection from permission presets, including native slash shortcuts for plan, permissions, review, and diff.
- Chat views gained context usage tracking, compact/handoff controls, and raw transcript search navigation.
- Mobile and tile chat surfaces show clearer attention alerts and less clipped status indicators.
- Windows Codex sandbox runner diagnostics are filtered out of normal chat output, with clearer guidance when Full access is needed.
- Provider model settings can be reordered by dragging rows.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-05-04

AgentHero 0.1.8 improved installed update handling by replacing automatic installed update execution with manual release download links. The app now surfaces update choices more clearly and ships as a full macOS release asset when platform-specific packaging is needed.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-05-04

AgentHero 0.1.7 focused on macOS installed updater reliability. Release asset URLs are resolved against the remote manifest so installed macOS builds can download the correct update package even when manifests contain relative asset paths.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-05-04

AgentHero 0.1.6 shipped as a platform-neutral patch for day-to-day app behavior:

- File Explorer popout state is preserved more consistently.
- Reveal and send actions were refined for project file workflows.
- Native folder picker fallback behavior was hardened, especially for Windows launches where the native picker can be hidden by scheduled-task startup behavior.
- macOS-specific UI behavior was tightened by hiding unsupported WSL runtime choices.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-05-04

AgentHero 0.1.5 was the first major release, consolidating the local dashboard, agent launch workflows, project-aware file tools, mobile access, and Windows/macOS installer and update foundations into a complete installable app.
